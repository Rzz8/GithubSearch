This web app allows you to search Github user with details of languages, repositories, stars and forks.

The front end is constructed using React, combined with Auth0 for user authentication (also allows social connections such as Google, Facebook, etc.). The API is from Github with their current user profile.

The use of FusionCharts allows us have a great view of used languages, most stared repos, stars per language, and most forked repos.

Follow the below steps to run codes in a local IDE (e.g., VS Code): <br />
1: Download the code zip files by clicking the green "Code" button next to the "Add file" button. Then click "Download ZIP" to download the files. <br /> 2. Extract files from the downloaded zip files. <br /> 3. Open the file folder "GithubSearch-master" in VS Code. <br /> 4. Open a new terminal and install dependencies: "npm install". <br /> 7. Start the server in the terminal: "npm start". <br /> 9. Go to "http://localhost:3000/" to see the app.
